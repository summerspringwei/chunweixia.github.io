        My research aims at build system softwares that are cost-effective and easy to use.
        
        **System for AI**. I am working on building compilers/frameworks to improve the performance of AI applications.
        This line of research have successfully produced several papers on top level computer science conferences, including
        [TT4GNN (to be apeared on IPDPS'25)], 
        [LSMR (on ICCAD'24)](https://2024.iccad.com/accepted-papers),
        [Souffle (on ASPLOS'24)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3617232.3624858), 
        [ChaoPIM (on ATS'21)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9668221) and
        [DNNTune on TACO'19](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3368305).

        **AI for System**. I start using AI to build system software in a cost-effective way from 2023.
        several important papers were published on 
        [IPDPS'25], 
        [ACL'24](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.55.pdf), 
        [ICSE'24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3597503.3639212).
