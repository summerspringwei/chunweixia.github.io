## About Me


I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the School of Computer Science at the University of Leeds. 
I am also a member of the [Distributed Systems and Services Group](https://engineering.leeds.ac.uk/info/201552/our_research/294/distributed_systems_and_services) at Leeds.
I am a recipient of the **2023 ACM SIGHPC China Doctoral Dissertation Award**.

My research broadly covers computer architecture, compilers, heterogeneous computing, distributed systems, and deep learning.
My current **research interests** include two main areas: (1) building system software using large language models, and (2) creating scalable and cost-effective infrastructures for AI applications: 

* **Large Language Model for System Software:** I am interested in how to use the Large Language Model (LLM) to construct compilers and decompilers to optimize programs and lift binary codes effectively.

* **Performant and cost-effective infrastructures for AI applications:** I work to design and implement Deep Learning (DL) Compilers and frameworks to improve the performance and energy efficiency of emerging AI applications on heterogeneous computing platforms.
